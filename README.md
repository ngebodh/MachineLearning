# MachineLearning
This repo contains machine learning projects that span different subject areas from SVM to Deep Learning. More to come...

## Deep Learning
### Image Recognition
* [Here](/DeepLearning/ImageRecog/DeepLearningWithKeras-ImageRecog.ipynb) we use the ResNet50 model in keras to perform image recognition.
* [Here](/DeepLearning/ImageRecog/DeepLearningWithKeras_ImageRecog_VGG16.ipynb) we use the VGG16 model in keras to perform image recognition.
* [Here](DeepLearning/ImageRecog/DeepLearning_DigitClassificationWithKeras.ipynb) we build a deep neural network to classify hand written digits from the MNIST dataset. 

## SVMs
### Image Classification
* [Here](SVM/EigenFaces_PCA.ipynb) we use a combination of PCA and SVMs to classify famous faces
